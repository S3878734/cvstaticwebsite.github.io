            <h2><strong>Discription</strong></h2>
            <p1><strong>My Old Team's Project</strong></p1>
            <p>THis is one of the project I created with a team during my time in University.</p>
            <p>While I was still in School everybody are still hiding from COVID-19 so no body went to campus and rely on studying online. But since most of RMIT's facilities can only be reserve through offline ways so it cause some inconvinient for lot of students. So we decided to create a booking and reservation app for RMIT University. We decided to make an app instead of a website because it was proved that mmost people spend 90% of their time on app and only 10% on website (Jmango,2020).</p>
            <h2><strong>Project Aim</strong></h2>
            <p>The Aim for this project is to provide RMIT's students body a better experience in booiking and reserving RMIT facilities. With this app you can now instead of going directly to the facilities to check for information and to book your reservation, you can do it directly from home to save you the energy and avoid wasting your time. You can also have a chat with the librarian about any inqueires you have about the library. Further more, the app also remind you of any incoming or importent meeting and also updating you about new events that RMIT university are hosting.</p>
            <h2><strong>Feed back</strong></h2>
            <p>After a week of posting our app prototype on facebook, we have recieved 250 responses all from RMIT student with 99% positive result and the student body all want it to be fully made to provide support to RMIT students.</p>
